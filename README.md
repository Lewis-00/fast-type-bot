# fast-type-bot 🚀⌨️

## Hey there 👋
This is just a little project I made to mess around with Python. 
Nothing serious, just a cool bot called Fast Type Bot that automatically types text from the typing game MonkeyType. 
You can adapt this bot to other websites with a few small changes. It's a fun experiment and there's always room to tweak it and make it better

### What does it do 🤔
- Loads the MonkeyType website using Selenium
- Grabs the words displayed on the page
- Types them back into the input field for you (at a set speed using pyautogui)
### How to use 🛠️
- Press Enter to start typing the first block of words
- Press Ctrl+Alt+1 to refresh and type the next set of words
- Press Delete to stop the bot

### Future improvements 😎
Add support for more websites
Let users adjust the typing speed
Make the bot smarter, maybe with error detection
