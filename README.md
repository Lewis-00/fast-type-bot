Fast Type Bot 🚀⌨️
Hey there 👋 This is just a fun little Python project I made to mess around with Python and have a good time. It’s nothing serious, just a cool bot called Fast Type Bot that automatically types text from the typing game MonkeyType. It uses Selenium to grab the text and pyautogui to simulate typing on your keyboard.

With a few small changes, you can adapt this bot to other websites too. It's a fun experiment and there's always room to tweak it and make it better 😊

What does it do 🤔
The bot:

Loads the MonkeyType website using Selenium
Grabs the words displayed on the page
Types them back into the input field for you (at a set speed using pyautogui)
How to use
Press Enter to start typing the first block of words
Press Ctrl+Alt+1 to refresh and type the next set of words
Press Delete to stop the bot

Future improvements
Add support for more websites
Let users adjust the typing speed
Make the bot smarter, maybe with error detection
Enjoy playing around with it 🚀
